This page guides you through setting up a ForoPay account, making your first payment request and using one of our ready solutions to accept payments.

## Step 1: Create a test account

Get started with ForoPay by creating a free test account. Your test account gives you access to the test Customer Area, which is a unified dashboard where you can manage your ForoPay integration across regions and currencies.

Your test Customer Area account allows you to:

- Make test payments.
- Invite team members.
- Apply for a live account.
- Start building your integration.

## Step 2: Get your API key



## Step 3. Build your integration

Start building your integration using your test account. You can also start your application for a live account. You may want to wait for your application to be approved before you build your whole integration.

Choose your integration to match your business needs:
