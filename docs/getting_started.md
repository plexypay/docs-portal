This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your ForoPay account, making your first payment request, and utilising our ready-made solutions to accept payments.

## Step 1: Create a test account

To get started with ForoPay, create a free test account. This account grants you access to the test Customer Area, a unified dashboard where you can manage your ForoPay integration across different regions and currencies.

With your test Customer Area account, you can:

- Perform test payments
- Invite team members
- Apply for a live account
- Start building your integration.

## Step 2: Get your API key



## Step 3. Build your integration

Start building your integration using your test account. You can also proceed with the application for a live account, but waiting for your application to be approved may be beneficial before completing the full integration.

Choose the integration option that best suits your business needs:

<DocsCards>
  <DocsCard header="Hosted page" href="/docs-portal/online_payments/accept_payments/hosted_checkout_page">
    <p>Use ForoPay's secure and reliable integrated checkout page to handle payments for your customers.</p>
  </DocsCard>

  <DocsCard header="Popup" href="/docs-portal/online_payments/accept_payments/popup">
    <p>Allow visitors to securely shop on your webshop without leaving your site.
    </p>
  </DocsCard>

  <DocsCard header="Drop-in" href="/docs-portal/online_payments/accept_payments/drop_in">
    <p>List all payment methods in one block with the drop-in integration.</p>
  </DocsCard>

  <DocsCard header="Hosted fields" href="/docs-portal/online_payments/accept_payments/hosted_fields">
    <p>Maintain your website's branding while ensuring card data security with hosted fields.</p>
  </DocsCard>

  <DocsCard header="API only" href="/docs-portal/online_payments/accept_payments/api">
    <p>Build your own payment form and process transactions using our APIs for maximum control and flexibility.</p>
  </DocsCard>
</DocsCards>

## Step 4: Verify test cases



## Step 5: Go live
